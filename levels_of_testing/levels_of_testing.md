## Component Testing (Unit Testing)

**Explanation:**

Component Testing, also known as Unit Testing, is the first level of software testing where individual components (or units) of a software are tested.

<details>
    <summary>Overview:</summary>

1. **Isolation:** In **unit testing**, components are tested in isolation from the rest of the system. This means that if a test fails, it's clear that the fault is within the unit under test.

2. **Mocking:** Creating mock objects to simulate the behavior of real objects.

3. **White-Box Testing:** Unit testing is a type of **white-box testing** as it requires knowledge of the **internal structure** of the unit to write the tests.

4. **Automated:** Unit tests are typically automated and run as part of the build process. This allows for regular **regression testing** as the codebase evolves.

5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Is a key part of TDD(Test-driven development), a **development methodology** where failing unit tests are written before the code is written to make them pass.

6. **Coverage:** A measure of how much of the codebase is tested by unit tests.

## Component Integration Testing (Unit Integration Testing)

**Explanation:**

Component Integration Testing, also known as **Unit Integration Testing**, is the process of testing the interactions or interfaces between two or more components within the same module or application.

<details>
    <summary>Overview:</summary>

1. **Interaction Between Units:** The main focus of integration testing is to test the interaction points between different units.

2. **Applicability:** Not mandatory for all applications. Conducted if the application has features requiring component interactions.

3. **Integration Testing Levels:**
    - **Component Integration Testing:** Within the same module.

    - **System Integration Testing:** Between different modules or systems.

4. **Web Services Integration:** Includes testing **APIs** to ensure correct request processing and response handling.

5. **Integration Strategy:** Existing integration strategies approaches.
    - **Bottom-Up Integration** is an approach where testing starts with the lower-level modules and progresses upwards. Lower-level modules are integrated and tested first, and then higher-level modules are added and tested incrementally.

    - **Top-Down Integration**  is an approach where testing starts with the higher-level modules and progresses downwards. Higher-level modules are integrated and tested first, and then lower-level modules are added and tested incrementally.

    - **Big Bang Integration** is an approach where all modules are integrated simultaneously after they have been developed and unit tested. The entire system is then tested as a whole.

## System Testing

**Explanation:**

System Testing is a level of testing that validates the complete and integrated software product.

<details>
    <summary>Overview:</summary>

1. **Whole System:** When we checking the system based specified requirements.

2. **Functional and Non-Functional Testing:**
    - **Functional Testing:** valdiate that the system meets the functional requirements.

    - **Non-Functional Testing:** Although **system testing** itself is primarily **functional**, it serves as a prerequisite for **non-functional testing**.

3. **End-to-End Testing:** Validates the complete workflow by checking integrated components function works together.

4. **Environment-Related Factors:** Testing the system in an environment that close the production environment, including hardware configurations, operating systems, network conditions, and software configurations.

5. **Independent Test Team:** System testing is often performed by an independent test team to provide an unbiased, fresh perspective, specialized skills, and increased accountability and transparency in the testing process.

6. **Product Risks:** Mitigate product risks that can only be assessed when the system is fully integrated, such as performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, end-to-end functionality, and user experience.

7. **Incomplete Requirements:** If there are incomplete requirements and product risks that were not fully understood or defined during earlier phases, secure that the final product meets all user needs and business requirements.

8. **Simulations and Subsystems:** System testing may use simulations of subsystems or services to create a representative test environment.

</details>

## System Integration Testing

**Explanation:**

System Integration Testing (SIT) is a testing phase where individual units or components of a software system are combined and tested as a group.

<details>
    <summary>Overview:</summary>

1. **Interaction Between Systems:** SIT focuses on testing the interfaces and interactions between two or more systems or components. This includes both internal and external systems that communicate with each other.

2. **Test Environment:** SIT should be executed in an environment that close to the production environment.

3. **End-to-End Testing:** Can also be part of SIT when it involves interactions between multiple systems or components, such as microservices.

</details>

## Acceptance Testing

**Explanation:**

Acceptance Testing is the final level of software testing performed after System and Integration Testing. It aims to evaluate the system's compliance with the business requirements.

<details>
    <summary>Key Concepts:</summary>

1. **User Perspective:** Acceptance testing is conducted from the user's perspective.

2. **Business Requirements:** The main focus of acceptance testing is to validate the system against business requirements.

3. **Types of Acceptance Testing:**
    - **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** This is the final phase of acceptance testing where the actual users test the software to validate the functionality and usability.

    - **Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT):** OAT focuses on validating the operational aspects of the system to ensure it can be deployed, installed, and operated in the environment.

    - **Contract and Regulatory Acceptance Testing:** Ensures that the system meets contract obligations and regulatory standards.

4. **Alpha and Beta Testing:**
    - **Alpha Testing:** Conducted by the customer in a pre-production environment to validate the product before it is released.

    - **Beta Testing:** Conducted by a limited number of end users in the real environment to gather feedback before the product is officially released.

5. **End-user or Stakeholder Involvement:** Most of the time, end-users or stakeholders perform acceptance testing. QA teams prepare the environment and ensure everything is working correctly before handing it over for acceptance testing. QA teams may also perform preliminary acceptance testing to verify that the system is ready for end-user testing.
